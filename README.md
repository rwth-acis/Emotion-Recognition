# Emotion-Recognition
A REST api which performs on request Speech and Text emotion recognition. Works together with a Mongo DB where the data is stored for future retrieval.
Is uses a known Github repository to train and evaluate a model which performs speech recognition. The training is done on various public datasets such as: 
- Ravdess
- EmoDB 
- TESS

The service also provides automatic transcription for the english language. The results are given in prediction probabilites.

The Service expects RESTFUL Get and Post requests, a futher overview if possible by looking at the SWAGGER documentation, which is avaliable under 

```
POST <service-address>/static/swagger.json
```



<!-- ### `static/emotion/speech" : "POST"` -->
The application expects a JSON file with the audio file in base64 format in with the tag "fileBody", aswell as a a user identifier under the tag "userid", in order to properly store the entries on the database.
The response is JSON file with the predicted emotion, and speech to text result.

```
POST <service-address>/static/emotion/speech
```



<!-- ### `"static/emotion/text": "POST"` -->
The application expects a JSON file with the text under the tag "text", and a user identifier under the tag "userid".

```



<!-- ### `"/static/test/": "POST"` -->
A connection test. It expects a JSON file, the respond should be the same JSON file

## MongoDB Database

To be a able to collect the data for later use, this webservice need to pare with an instance of a MongoDB. Then, after each recollection or recognition an entry will be stored in the data base Emotion/Users with the predicted text, predicted emotion, and an identifier. 


## Speech Emotion Recognition

The predicting models stems from the repository in the following link. The training data is listed above. The classifier used was a Deep FF Neural network.

## Speech To Text
